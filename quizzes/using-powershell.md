# Using Powershell Quiz

## 1. How do you update a module with the Update-Module command that wasn't downloaded from the PowerShell Gallery?

You can't--you are only able to update modules installed locally from the PowerShell Gallery with the Update-Module command that were originally downloaded from the PowerShell Gallery.

## 2. What is the primary purpose of a module?

To contain similar commands to more easily transport and manage. A module will always contain one or more commands. When packaging up commands in a module, it allows the user to more easily move commands around and work with them in groups. 

## 3. What is a major benefit of building functions rather than scripts?

Functions allow you to build encapsulated, reusable code snippets that you can call with other commands and scripts.
